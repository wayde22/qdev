# Calculator

Using the JavaScript skills you've learned, implement a 4-function calculator. You can start by forking this repository into a personal GitLab project, and then removing the fork relationship.

The calculator should be able to add, multiply, subtract, and divide decimal numbers, and should support the memory add, memory recall, and memory clear functions, as well as an "all clear" function to reset the calculator.

This assignment can be accomplished using a variety of techniques for event handling and DOM manipulation. Experiment and discover what works best. When you're done, push your source to GitLab.
