  <p>I love playing and coaching sports. When I have spare time I like to play basketball with my kids, with friends, or just go to the court for a pickup game. I have coached my daughter and sons soccer teams a few years ago, and I coached both of my sons basketball team. I love watching football, both NFL and college and I like to go to Bears games when I have the opportunity. <p className = "App">  <img src='https://pictshare.net/454vsi9uk2.gif'></img>
